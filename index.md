## About Me

I am a cryptography researcher with a background in both mathematics and computer science. My work bridges rigorous mathematical foundations and practical cryptographic applications, particularly in post-quantum security, homomorphic encryption, and quantum cryptanalysis.

Beyond research, I actively engage in mentoring and academic service. I served as the president of the FAU AWM Graduate Student Chapter and help organize outreach efforts supporting diversity in mathematics.
